# Dummy Node Singly Linked List Implementation in C++

This project demonstrates a **Singly Linked List** in C++ that uses a **dummy head node**. The dummy node is a placeholder at the beginning of the list, simplifying the insertion and deletion operations by ensuring that there's always a head node present.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `list.h`: Header file defining the `List` class and its member functions.
- `list.cpp`: Implementation of the list operations.
- `main.cpp`: The main file for testing the linked list functions (not provided here).

## Features

The **List** class provides several methods to work with a singly linked list using a dummy node:

### Constructor

- **`List()`**: Initializes the list with a dummy head node that contains no meaningful data (`data = -1`). The dummy node simplifies the list management, especially during insertions and deletions.

### Public Methods

- **`bool isEmpty()`**: Checks if the list is empty by verifying whether the dummy node points to `nullptr`.

- **`void insert_begin(int value)`**: Inserts a new node with `value` at the beginning of the list, right after the dummy node.

- **`void insert_end(int value)`**: Inserts a new node with `value` at the end of the list.

- **`void delete_begin()`**: Deletes the first node after the dummy node. If the list is empty, an error message is displayed.

- **`void traverse()`**: Traverses the list starting from the node after the dummy node and prints the values of the nodes until the end of the list.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the **List** class:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include "list.h"

int main() {
    List myList;

    myList.insert_begin(10);
    myList.insert_end(20);
    myList.insert_end(30);
    
    cout << "List after insertion: ";
    myList.traverse();  // Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL

    myList.delete_begin();
    cout << "List after deleting the first element: ";
    myList.traverse();  // Output: 20 -> 30 -> NULL

    return 0;
}
